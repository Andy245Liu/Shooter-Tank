# Shooter-Tank

Defend your fortress against an incoming missile attack! The red missiles are headed for your fortress and it is up to you and your tank to intercept them. To control your tank, press "a" to move left, "w" to move up, "d" to move right, and "s" to move down. Use your mouse to aim at the missiles and left click to shoot; you've got a 360-degree turret! Click multiple times to rapid fire. You may need multiple shots to take down a missile! If a missile reaches your fortress on the left, it's game over!
